# Harvard CS50AI Projects
*Jul 2025 - Aug 2025*

All 12 completed projects from Harvard CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python course.

## Overview
0. Search
   - `degrees`: AI that finds the degrees of seperation between actors using BFS
   - `tictactoe`: unbeatable tic-tac-toe AI using minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
1. Knowledge
   - `knights`: solve "Knights and Knaves" logic puzzle games
   - `minesweeper`: knowledge-based minesweeper AI that makes makes moves based on its knowledge base and inferences
2. Uncertainity
   - `pagerank`: AI that implements Google's PageRank algorithm using both the random surfer model and PageRank formula
   - `heredity`: AI that calculates the probability of a particular genetic trait existing in a given person based on oneself's and family's genetic data
3. Optimization
   - `crossword`: AI that generates crossword puzzles by ensuring node and arc consistency across all words and implementing backtracking search for optimized puzzles
4. Learning
   - `shopping`: K-Nearest Neighbors model that predicts whether or not a person purchased an item (~40% true positive rate and ~90% true negative rate)
   - `nim`: reinforcement learning agent that plays the game Nim through the Q-learning algorithm
5. Neural Networks
   - `traffic`: CNN model that classifies traffic signs using tensorflow (~98% accuracy)
6. Language
   - `parser`: AI that parses sentences and extracts noun phrases using the nltk library
   - `attention`: MLM that predicts a masked word in a text sequence using the BERT transformer from Hugging Face
