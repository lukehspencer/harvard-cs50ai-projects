*Jul 2025 - Aug 2025*

Completed all 12 projects from Harvard CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python course.

## Overview
0. Search
   - [Degrees](./degrees/): AI that solves the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon problem by finding the connections between any two actors through movies using BFS
   - [Tic-Tac-Toe](./tictactoe/): unbeatable tic-tac-toe AI using minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
1. Knowledge
   - [Knights](./knights/): solve "Knights and Knaves" logic puzzle games
   - [Minesweeper](./minesweeper/): knowledge-based minesweeper AI that makes makes moves based on its knowledge base and inferences
2. Uncertainity
   - [PageRank](./pagerank/): AI that implements Google's PageRank algorithm using both the random surfer model and PageRank formula
   - [Heredity](./heredity/): AI that calculates the probability of a particular genetic trait existing in a given person based on oneself's and family's genetic data
3. Optimization
   - [Crossword](./crossword/): AI that generates crossword puzzles by ensuring node and arc consistency across all words and implementing backtracking search for optimized puzzles
4. Learning
   - [Shopping](./shopping/): KNN model that predicts whether or not a person purchased an item based on 12,000+ shopping records (~40% TPR and ~90% TNR)
   - [Nim](./nim/): reinforcement learning agent that plays the game Nim through the Q-learning algorithm
